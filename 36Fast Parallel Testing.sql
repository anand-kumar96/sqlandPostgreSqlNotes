        SELECT * FROM test.users;

--> 10: how postgres know which schema should we access if not mention in query
        SELECT * FROM users; --> default use public schema
    --> this can be done by postgres because postgres uses internally search_path variable
    --> to see run below command in query tool
        SHOW search_path;
