    /*  Supertest is a popular library used for testing HTTP servers in JavaScript projects. 
        It allows you to make HTTP requests to your server and assert the responses, enabling you to test your API endpoints 
        in an automated and controlled manner.
                                            Overall, Supertest is a powerful and flexible tool for testing HTTP servers in JavaScript projects. 
        It simplifies the process of testing API endpoints, ensuring that your server behaves as expected and meets your 
        application's requirements.

--> 05: Multi-DB Setup
    --> above error due to we are expecting 0 users but we are getting 1 users in db because we rae trying to access socailnetwork
    --> database in two mode one in app development mode and another is app test mode
    --> in bpoth senario we are connecting to same database due to which since database has already one users that's why 
    --> in test mode return count as 1 and our test is failing.

    --> we can solve it different ways
    --> 1 we can delete all the tables before testing the app from db which is such a bad approach.
    --> 2 Instead we can create another database socialnetwork-test and we test here. this is good solution
    --> so create database in pg admin
    --> now change database name in connect function and run test
        npm run test

    --> ERROR =>  error: relation "users" does not exist
    --> because we just created database not run any migration in db so that's why we getting error
